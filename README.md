<h2 align="center" id="about42">  About 42 </h2>

42 is a global education initiative that proposes a new way of learning technology: no teachers, no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer learning), with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills. Not to mention that it's completely free of charge and open to all with no prerequisites.

<h2 align="center" id="admissions">  Admissions </h2>
Admissions at 42 are unlike other colleges. We use a merit-based admission process.
The final step of the admission is the Piscine - This is part of the admissions process and requires 4 weeks of intensive and immersive coding. No prior coding experience is necessary at all.

<h3 align="center" id="hard-skills"> Hard Skills </h3>

#### C Language
	The primary language learned at the 42's Piscine is C: dealing with variables,
	pointers, memory allocation, macros, as well as creating functions and programs,
	including the use and creation of libraries and Makefiles.

#### Shell
	The first two days of the bootcamp are dedicated to learning basic to intermediate
	shell commands to seamlessly navigate through the terminal.

#### Git
	All projects are submitted via a remote git repository, which demands students to
	be at ease with such a system.

<h3 align="center" id="soft-skills"> Soft Skills </h3>

#### Self-learning and proactiveness
		At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There
		are no teachers whatsoever; the learning process is based on googling, enquiring
		your classmates, and empirical knowledge, each student learning at their own pace.

#### Teamwork
		On weekends, a 48h team project called "Rush" is proposed: a 3-member group randomly
		chosen by the school's system must collaboratively develop a fully running application.
		The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge levels while finding a
		common work methodology that allows all team members to contribute to the project.

#### Time management and resiliency
		The school is open 24/7. Thus, the so-called "pisciners" are free to work whenever
		they want, which demands excellent time management skills and resiliency for not
		"drowning" amid the massive load of work demanded by the non-stop 26-day program.
